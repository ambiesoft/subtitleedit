1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,660
China and Japan are two countries that have
been culturally intertwined from as early

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,580
as 400 AD.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,750
This relationship led to Japan adopting the
Chinese writing system, the religion of Buddhism,

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,960
similar political systems, as well as developing
in matters of food, fashion, law, and more,

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,609
under the influence of China.

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,789
Although the countries are currently at peace,
relations have remained somewhat tense over

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:21,800
the last century.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,570
Today, we’ll compare the two nations in
a hypothetical military match-up, in this

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,560
episode of The Infographics Show, China vs.
Japan.

Notification Squad.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,690
The USA has the world’s highest GDP of around
18.5 trillion dollars.

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,930
It’s followed by China with a nominal GDP
of 11.8 trillion dollars, and then Japan with

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,850
a GDP of around 4.8 trillion dollars.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,489
The European Union would take second place,
but the EU is a combination of 28 states.

16
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,359
While China has experienced economic prosperity
in recent years, it’s per capita GDP ranks

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,820
low, globally in 70th place, at around 8,000
dollars, with Japan’s per capita GDP much

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,390
higher at around 39,000 dollars.

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,490
There is certainly less money to go around
in China as it has the world’s largest population

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,060
of 1.38 billion people, compared to Japan’s
126-plus million population.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,560
In terms of military spending, China ranks
third behind Russia and the military-minded

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,180
USA, with a defense budget of around $147
billion, which is 2.1% of its GDP.

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,520
Japan sits in 7th place on this list, with
a $43 billion defense budget, which is 0.9%

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,740
of its GDP.

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,360
It’s also worth mentioning here that military
pundits often state China spends much more

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,619
on its military than the number that is reported,
although China’s finance minister denied

27
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:47,070
this secrecy in 2017, saying, “Let me be
very clear, there is no such thing as opacity

28
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,979
in China’s military spending.”

29
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,759
While Japan is regarded as being a military
powerhouse, it’s number of military personnel

30
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,810
is actually quite small, and very much inferior
to the number of personnel the Chinese employ.

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,470
Japan has around 250,000 active military personnel,
with another 57,900 people acting as reserve

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,490
personnel.

33
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,640
China on the other hand has a massive 2,335,000
active frontline personnel and 2,300,000 active

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,480
reserve personnel and paramilitary forces.

35
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,150
Japan’s personnel numbers may be small,
but it's protected with some of the world’s

36
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,650
best military equipment.

37
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:28,439
This includes 678 Tanks, 2,850 armored fighting
vehicles, 202 self-propelled guns, 500 Towed-Artillery,

38
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,569
and 99 multiple launch rocket systems.

39
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:35,150
It’s large fleet of land artillery includes
two machines often on the list of the world’s

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,511
most advanced tanks, those being the Japanese-made
Type 10 Main Battle Tank and Type 90 Main

41
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:41,511
Battle Tank.

42
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:51,140
China, however, outguns Japan considerably
with a total of 9,150 tanks, 4,788 AFVs, 1,710

43
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,930
SPGs, 6,246 Towed-Artillery, and 177 MLRSs.

44
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,950
China’s Type 99 main battle tank is also
highly rated, while the country also claims

45
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,780
to have developed the most advanced tank in
the world in its VT-4.

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,170
China is not alone in making such boastful
claims, with the USA and Russia also stating

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,629
they have the best tanks in the M1A2 Abrams
and the T-14 Armata, respectively.

48
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:19,080
The VT-4 is as much a Chinese war machine
as it is a profitable export, with Thailand

49
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,530
placing a big order of the tanks, and other
countries showing interest in buying.

50
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,380
Both countries have strong air forces, with
China owning around 2,900-plus aircraft and

51
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,440
206 attack helicopters.

52
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,599
Japan has around 1,590 aircraft and 119 attack
helicopters.

53
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,239
In terms of strength, China’s aerial piece
de resistance is its new Chengdu J-20 stealth

54
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:46,110
fighter, which the air force, and some aviation
experts, have stated can match America’s

55
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,450
highly advanced Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor
and F-35.

56
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,650
China is also the only country to have bought
the Russian beasts of the skies, the Sukhoi

57
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,709
Su-35 multipurpose fighter.

58
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,200
If you’ve seen our shows on these aircraft,
you’ll know the Su-35 alone is an impeccable

59
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,819
piece of engineering.

60
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,200
Japan would be hard pushed to equal such aerial
military might, but the country is no slouch

61
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,590
when it comes to aircraft.

62
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,860
Japan is said to have created a veritable
equal to China’s J-20, having joined the

63
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,610
stealth leagues with its own Mitsubishi X-2.

64
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,640
Japan has some formidable combat aircraft
in its homemade Mitsubishi F-2, as well as

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,560
American made F-4 Phantom IIs and F-15 Eagles.

66
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,140
The country is also the proud owner of the
USA’s highly touted F-35 Lightning II.

67
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,310
Japan currently has one of these aircraft,
but another 42 have been ordered.

68
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,800
With this in mind, the two countries seem
to be fairly evenly matched in terms of air

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,110
force equipment, with Japanese imports being
a major factor.

70
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,540
As far as naval power is concerned, a matter
of significance given the history of naval

71
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,110
invasions, and the fact that the countries
are separated by a stretch of water.

72
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,080
Both countries are credited with having very
strong navies, although most analysts rank

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,760
China above Japan.

74
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,540
The People’s Liberation Army Navy is said
to have grown from a fairly weak outfit consisting

75
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,800
of old ships to a formidable foe due to massive
injections of money since China’s economic

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
boom.

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,250
The navy not only has well over 100,000 personnel,
but has a large fleet of ships.

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,620
This includes one aircraft carrier, 35 destroyers,
51 frigates, 35 corvettes, 31 mine warfare,

79
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,410
3 amphibious transports, 8 nuclear attack
submarines, and around 50 conventional attack

80
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,410
submarines.

81
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:28,370
By comparison, the Japanese navy consists
of around 114 ships and 45,800 personnel,

82
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,470
and according to nationalinterest.org, its
fleet of 17 submarines is as good as any submarine

83
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,470
fleet in the world.

84
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,350
In total, Japan has 3 Aircraft Carriers, 43
Destroyers, 6 Coastal Defense Craft, 0 Frigates,

85
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,000
0 Corvettes, and 25 mine warfare.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,830
A matter of importance is each country’s
nuclear capabilities.

87
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,750
Japan doesn’t have any nuclear weapons,
although it is protected by the United States

88
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,140
under the nuclear umbrella.

89
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,880
The country is well known for its highly advanced
industries and technology, and there is no

90
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,320
doubt that it could develop its own nuclear
weapons given its nuclear energy infrastructure.

91
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,750
This has so far not happened due to a non-nuclear
weapons policy, although being positioned

92
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,460
so close to North Korea, many Japanese politicians
and military officials have called for a change

93
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,990
in nuclear weapons policy.

94
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,220
China, on the other hand, is one of 9 nations
with nuclear weapons, with a considerable

95
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,330
arsenal of around 260 warheads.

96
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,310
It’s first nuclear test was in 1964.

97
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,000
The number of weapons, however, and China’s
development of nuclear weapons, has been a

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,820
matter of wide speculation.

99
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,600
For instance, a Georgetown University study
claimed that China’s nuclear weapons arsenal

100
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,630
is not in the hundreds, but possibly 3,000.

101
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,760
The study claimed the weapons were hidden
in secret underground tunnels.

102
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,460
The prospect of any kind of conflict involving
these weapons of mass destruction, however,

103
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,180
is highly unlikely.

104
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:44,640
We cannot forget that almost every single
tank, aircraft, or naval unit needs fuel to

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
operate.

106
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,770
China currently consumes approximately 12
million (11,968,000) barrels of oil a day,

107
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,820
but it only produces about 4 million (3,980,000)
barrels daily.

108
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,210
That said, it does have 25 billion barrels
in reserves.

109
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,980
Japan, on the other hand, consumes 4.15 million
barrels of oil a day, but it only produces

110
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,890
a meager 3,900 barrels daily.

111
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,870
Worse yet, it only has 44 million barrels
of oil in reserves.

112
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,330
So, who do you think has a stronger military?

113
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,330
China or Japan?

114
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,730
Let us know why in the comments!
